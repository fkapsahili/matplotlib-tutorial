# Exercises
You'll find the exercises within the Jupyter Notebooks.

The expected format to hand in your solutions to the exercises is a PDF file.
For each exercise provide the title of the respective Notebook as a heading and the exercise's title
as a subheading.
After the heading, provide the Python code with your solution and a screenshot of the graphic generated.
Your text is expected to be copy-pastable into the Jupyter Notebook containing the respective exercise.

Example: Your solution to the exercise at the bottom of notebook ["Matplotlib_Tut-Part1-Figures_Subplots_and_layouts.ipynb"](https://github.zhaw.ch/wagb/datavislab/tree/main/matplotlib_tut/Matplotlib_Tut-Part1-Figures_Subplots_and_layouts.ipynb)
will start with the heading `Matplotlib_Tut-Part1-Figures_Subplots_and_layouts` followed by subheading `Quick Exercise: Exercise 1.1`.
Next follows the entire Python code of this Cell, including your solution which comes right after the comment line:
```Python
# Can you figure out what to do next to plot x vs y1, y2, and y3 on one figure?
```


# Installation
All you need is matplotlib jupyter installed.
You can use your favorite Python package installer for this:

```bash
pip install matplotlib jupyter
git clone https://github.zhaw.ch/wagb/datavislab
cd datavislab
jupyter notebook
```

or:

```bash
conda install matplotlib jupyter
git clone https://github.zhaw.ch/wagb/datavislab
cd datavislab
jupyter notebook
```
A browser window should appear and you can verify that everything works as expected by clicking on the `Test Install.ipynb` notebook. There, you will see a "code cell" that you can execute. Run it, and you should see a very simple line plot, indicating that all is well.
